used libraries:

 numpy as np
 pandas as pd
 matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
seaborn as sns

Eventhough included in the project , i only used the Sites data for the blog post. 
included all the steps that i used within the code.
tried to understand the distribution of the data set via seaborn. 
while analyzing the data set, observed that there are no missing Data in the sites data hence, i did not need a cleaning phase.
